                    Hey there! I&apos;m a versatile content creator who thrives
                    in fast-paced, deadline-driven environments. I&apos;m a
                    people person with strong communication skills, and I love
                    working with teams to coordinate production. When it comes
                    to traditional and digital audio and video production,
                    I&apos;m your go-to guy! I&apos;m skilled in using Adobe CC,
                    Microsoft Office, FCP X, Da-Vinci Resolve, and handling
                    cameras & lights. I&apos;m also a tech-savvy individual who
                    is comfortable working with different computer environments
                    such as Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
                </p>

                <br />

                    In addition to creating content, I&apos;m actively expanding
                    my knowledge in software development. I&apos;m currently
                    learning JavaScript, Python, React, Flask, and Node through
                    expert-led instruction. Learning new technologies hands-on
                    is my jam! And when I&apos;m not creating content or coding,
                    you can find me producing music or playing games -
                    Let&apos;s connect and explore our creative passions
                    together!
